# Supernatural Sapphics

Supernatural Sapphics is a role playing game for 2 or more players, one player taking the role of the Top, who runs the game, and the rest of the players take the role of Bottoms, which are characters in the game. This Distortion Dice game is about the messy queer relationships between beings of the veil (vampires, fae, ghosts, cryptids, etc) and the humans fascinated by them. This is not a game about working together to overcome a common goal, the characters in Supernatural Sapphics can be toxic, selfish, or simply naive and will end up hurting each other. Player vs Player conflict is not only expected, it is ecouraged. While this game does use terms like sapphic, woman, and lesbian, you are not required to play a lesbian, and all types of identities are welcome. However, it is fundamentally a game about disaster queers and their relationships, so if your desire is to play a cishet character, you should take time to examine why that is, and if that character would fit into the stories this game is meant to tell.

### Relationships 

Each relationship has a die rating and a statement about how you feel about that person. If you are acting in accordance to how you feel you use the die in your pool, otherwise you use a d4 relationship die. The die rating represents how important the relationship is, good or bad, and how sure you are of how you feel about this person.

You start with one relationship at d10, one at d8, two at d4 and the rest at d6


## Rolls

In order to affect the other characters around you, or when there's a risk involved for any action, you make a roll. Rolls in Supernatural Sapphics are made by building a dice pool, rolling against another dice pool, and comparing the highest and lowest die. Results are determined by who is the initiator, as well as what the highest and lowest die in each pool was.

You start by picking the stat that best matches your approach to the action you are attempting. You may also add in the relevant aspects and relationships that would help you, if rolling against another player you also get the relevant stress die for their approach. Whoever is opposing you gets the stress die that matches your approach, in addition to the dice for their own approach and any relevant aspects or relationships.

For the initiator, the Highest die determines if the result is extremely positive (beating the opposition by 5+), positive (beating or tying the opposition), or negative (beaten by the opposition).

The lowest die determines if there is a bonus effect (beating the opposition) or an extra cost (tie or being beaten by the opposition).

On a positive or extremely positive result, the initiator narrates the outcome. On a negative result, the opposition narrates. The initiator gets to decide what small bonus effect there is, and the opposition would decide the extra cost, which can be a narrative only consequence or stress.

## Stress

Stress is the negative consequences of things not going your way. Each stat has an associated stress track. Angry for Strong, Alone for Smooth, etc. Stress has a minimum value of a d4 and a maximum of d12. If a stress track would ever be raised above a d12, that character (whether a Bottom or Doll) is Overwhelmed and cannot act for the rest of the scene. When a character becomes Overwhelmed, their stress track resets to d4, and they must re-evaluate a relationship. If a relationship die was used in the roll that caused them to become Overwhelmed, that is the relationship that should be re-evaluated.

## Drive

Drive is gained when you suffer negative consequences, either through a negative result or a extra cost. You might also gain Drive by helping someone else reduce Stress, or by someone activating a Negative Aspect. You can spend one drive to step up a die in your pool to the next die size, this can be done multiple times on the same roll. You can also spend one to invoke a negative aspect in a roll against another character. Drive can also be spent after a roll to change the Stress a character takes to a different Stress track, this allows a character to avoid becoming Overwhelmed. You can spend 5 Drive to reevaluate a relationship, which allows you to change how you view that person. If you do this during a roll, use that relationship die twice. Re-evaluating a relationship fully clears one stress track.

## Reducing Stress

Reducing Stress can be done in three ways. The first is taking a moment to rest and process your emotions. This reduces a single stress track by 1 step.

The second is through connection. Talking to a friend or allowing someone to help you reduces your stress. The person helping will roll against the stress track they are trying to reduce. On an extremely positive result it is reduced by 3, on a positive result it is reduced by 2, and a negative result still reduces your stress by 1. The bonus effect is reducing a stress track of their own by 1, and an extra cost is raising their stress track by 1. This means that a negative result with an extra cost raises their stress by 2. As usual, the die being rolled by the person helping should be the one that best fits their approach to the problem. Helping someone else recover from stress always grants 1 Drive, regardless of any stress received.

The third is through reevaluating a relationship. If you spend 5 drive to re-evaulate a relationship, you fully clear a stress track.

## Reevaluating a Relationship

Re-evaluating a Relationship can happen in one of two ways. Spending Drive or becoming Overwhelmed. Either way, it has the same effect of resetting one Stress Track to d4, causing you to re-write one relationship, and giving you the opportunity to lower one relationship die in order to raise another relationship die.

# Setting up the game

## The Setting

The first step in setting up a game is to decide on a setting

Decide what sort of environment the game is set in

D6 | Setting
:-: | :-:
1 | Tropical
2 | Forest
3 | Mountainous
4 | Swamp
5 | Desert
6 | Plains

Decide what sort of settlement your story takes place in or near

D6 | Settlement
:-: | :-:
1 | A small rural village
2 | A sprawling metropolis
3 | A bustling trade port
4 | A popular tourist town
5 | An isolated bastion
6 | A sparsely populated rural area

## The Situation

The second step is to create a situation, and the people involved in it

### What new thing is causing a disruption?

D6 | Disruption
:-: | :-:
1 | A hot new being of the veil
2 | A hot new mortal has moved in
3 | Someone is searching for beings of the veil
4 | Construction is set to start near supernatural land
5 | Something new is calling on the power of the veil
6 | A being of the veil is doing something that might get them exposed

### Create some NPCs

Roll on the table below to Create 3-5 NPCs

NPCs come in two forms
- **Dolls** These are important NPCs that come with their own relationships and stress tracks.
- **Extras** These are simple NPCs that are essentially part of the environment that can talk. They will probably only have 1-3 dice that they can use.

D6 | Type | Style |Adjective | Person
:-: | :-: | :-:
1 | Tall | Butch | Ambitious | Witch
2 | Short | Femme | Nervous | Mothperson
3 | Athletic | Cottagecore |Curious | Fae
4 | Thicc | Futch | Territorial | Vampire
5 | Muscular | Goth | Vengeful | Ghost
6 | Thin | Punk | Greedy | Human

### Set their relationships

Give each NPC a d8 important relationship with another character. 1 or 2 d6 mildly important relationships. All unlisted relationships are a d4.

## Set the Scene

Ask the players where they are at and how they are responding to the disruption. Start the first scene with whoever got into a new relationship most recently and the Bottoms and NPCs that would be in that location as well.

## Call for rolls

When a character is trying to influence another character, or whenever a character is trying to overcome an obstacle with risks involved, a roll is called. The character initiating this action creates their dice pool first. For Bottoms, the dice is made up of the stat that best matches their approach, and any relevant assets and aspects. For the Top, the dice pool is made up of dice that represent the difficulty of the action, or from traits of the NPC. In addition to this, each party gets the appropriate stress die from their opposition, and can give their opponent 1 Drive to use a negative aspect. The highest die in each pool is compared.
The chatacter or obstacle with the highest die result gets what they want with the initiator winning ties.
The lowest die in each pool is also compared to determine if there is a bonus effect or an extra cost.

## Stress

NPCs have stress tracks just like Bottoms. However, Obstacles that take more than one action to overcome have a singular progress track that counts up just as a stress track would.

## Drive

The Top has Drive that can be spent just like the Bottoms. However, the Top gains drive in a different way. The Top starts with 1 drive for each Bottom, and gain Drive only when it is spent by Bottoms. For each Roll where a Bottom spends Drive, the Top will gain 1 Drive after the roll is resolved. When a Bottom spends 5 Drive to re-evaluate a relationship, the top gains 1 Drive.
