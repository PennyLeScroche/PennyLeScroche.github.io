# Supernatural Sapphics

Supernatural Sapphics is a role playing game for 2 or more players, one player taking the role of the Top, who runs the game and plays the Dolls (important NPCS), Extras (unimportant NPCS), and Obstacles (nonsentient beings, environmental hazards, or any other non-person barrier preventing progress). The rest of the players take the role of Bottoms, which are characters in the game. This Distortion Dice game is about the messy queer relationships between beings of the veil (vampires, fae, ghosts, cryptids, etc) and the humans fascinated by them. To play this game you will need several sets of polyhedral dice and optionally tokens to represent Drive.

This is not a game about working together to overcome a common goal, the characters in Supernatural Sapphics can be toxic, selfish, or simply naive and will end up hurting each other. Player vs Player conflict is not only expected, it is ecouraged. While this game does use terms like sapphic, woman, and lesbian, you are not required to play a lesbian, and all types of identities are welcome. However, it is fundamentally a game about disaster queers and their relationships, so if your desire is to play a cishet character, you should take time to examine why that is, and if that character would fit into the stories this game is meant to tell. 

Every character in Supernatural Sapphics is undeniably hot, regardless of body type, presentation, etc. they are still recognized as hot regardless of personal preferences. 

Please remember that while the characters can be toxic, manipulative, and self-centered, the other players at the table are real people with real feelings, so communicate as adults to ensure that everyone is comfortable and enjoying themselves. Tools like lines & veils, the X card, and Script Change are all helpful in this regard.

# Character Creation

## Stats

Stats are the different ways you can interact with the world, and be sexy. Each has an associated harm track that goes up when you get a negative result or extra cost when using that stat. Distribute a D10, D8, D6, and D4 between your Stats.

- Strong - being physically fit or approaching problems very directly
    - Angry
- Smooth - Social aptitude, and ability to connect with or manipulate people
    - Alone
- Smart - Knowledge and problem solving ability
    - Anxious
- Spirit - Ability to connect to the veil and use or resist otherworldly power
    - Afraid

## Aspects
 
### Positive

Positive Aspects are traits that your character has that helps them accomplish their goals. Set one to D8, two to D6, and one to D4.

- Your vibe
    - Choose one: Tough Butch, Confident Femme, Cottagecore, Sapphedemic, etc
- Your Skills
    - Choose one: Reading people, wilderness survival, astrology, automotive maintenance, electronics, savvy business-woman, etc
- Your connection to the veil
    - Choose one: You stumbled through it, you're a witch, you're a paranormal researcher, you're a cryptid, you're a vampire, you're fae, you're a ghost, etc
- Your Goals
    - Choose one: To fit in, to gain power, to become famous, to find someone fully devoted to you, to prove the haters wrong, etc

### Negative 

Negative Aspects are things that can hold you back. Set one to D8, and two to D6.

- Your type
    - Choose one: Tall women, butches, futches, nerdy women, etc
- Your pet peeve
    - Choose one: Arrogance, messy eaters, unkempt fingernails, interrupting you when you speak, ec
- Your insecurity
    - Choose one: Your math skills, your driving, your forgetfulness, your laugh, etc

### Relationships 

Stop here, and have the Top run the **Setting up the Game** section before continuing. Each relationship has a die rating and a statement about how you feel about that person. If you are acting in accordance to how you feel you use the die in your pool, otherwise you use a d4 as the relationship die. The die rating represents how important the relationship is, good or bad, and how sure you are of how you feel about this person.

You start with one relationship at d10, one at d8, two at d4 and the rest at d6.

### Starting Drive

Each Bottom starts with 1 Drive. Drive can be spent to enhance rolls, change your relationships, or affect scenes, this is described in more detail in the Drive section

## Bottom Principles

You are playing flawed individuals who often don't fully think things through when making decisions. You are encouraged to engage in toxic, manipulative, and self-destructive behavior in pursuit of your goals. Think of your Bottom as one of the main characters in queer drama TV show or movie with an ensemble cast.


## Rolls

In order to affect the other characters around you, or when there's a risk involved for any action, you make a roll. Rolls in Supernatural Sapphics are made by building a dice pool, rolling against another dice pool, and comparing the highest and lowest die. Results are determined by who is the initiator, as well as what the highest and lowest die in each pool was. Rolls can be made against other Bottoms, as well as Dolls, Extras, and other Obstacles.

Rolls follow the following procedure

1. Dettermine who is the Initiator and who is the Responder
2. Choose the Stat the best matches your approach
3. Add in relevant Aspects
4. Add in your relationship die. Use the die rating if you are acting in accordance to the relationship statement, or a d4 otherwise
5. Add in the opposing harm die
6. Spend Drive to raise dice or Invoke a negative Aspect
7. Roll and Compare

After each player rolls their dice pool, the highest die in their pool is the Effect, and the lowest die in their pool is the Effort. The player with the higher Effect gets to dictate how the exchange goes, and having a Effect that is 5 or more above the opposition is a Resounding Success for that Player, and results in an extra effect such as causing 2 stress instead of 1. The player with the higher Effort gets to add a small detail that goes their way, or apply 1 stress. The Initiator wins ties on the Effect die, and the Responder wins ties on the Effort die.

## Stress

Stress is the negative consequences of things not going your way. Each stat has an associated stress track. Angry for Strong, Alone for Smooth, etc. Stress has a minimum value of a d4 and a maximum of d12. If a stress track would ever be raised above a d12, that character (whether a Bottom or Doll) is Overwhelmed and cannot act for the rest of the scene. When a character becomes Overwhelmed, their stress track resets to d4, and they must re-evaluate a relationship. If a relationship die was used in the roll that caused them to become Overwhelmed, that is the relationship that should be re-evaluated.

## Reducing Stress

Reducing Stress can be done in three ways. The first is taking a moment to rest and process your emotions. This reduces a single stress track by 1 step.

The second is through connection. Talking to a friend or allowing someone to help you reduces your stress. The person helping will roll against the stress track they are trying to reduce. On an extremely positive result it is reduced by 3, on a positive result it is reduced by 2, and a negative result still reduces your stress by 1. The bonus effect is reducing a stress track of their own by 1, and an extra cost is raising their stress track by 1. This means that a negative result with an extra cost raises their stress by 2. As usual, the die being rolled by the person helping should be the one that best fits their approach to the problem. Helping someone else recover from stress always grants 1 Drive, regardless of any stress received.

The third is through reevaluating a relationship. If you spend 5 drive to re-evaulate a relationship, you fully clear a stress track.

## Drive

Drive is gained whenever you suffer a negative consequence, or whenever someone else invokes a negative aspect of yours.

Drive can be spend in the following ways. Each option starts with XD with X in place of the Drive cost of each option:

- 1D Raise a die in your roll (can be done multiple times)
- 1D Invoke a negative aspect against another character
- 1D Redirect stress to another stress track
- 1D Create a relationship with an Extra
- 1D Enter a scene you were not previously in
- 1D Introduce a scene element
- 5D Re-evaluate a relationship

## Reevaluating a Relationship

Re-evaluating a Relationship can happen in one of two ways. Spending Drive or becoming Overwhelmed. Either way, it has the same effect of resetting one Stress Track to d4, causing you to re-write one relationship, and giving you the opportunity to lower one relationship die in order to raise another relationship die. If you Reevaluate a Relationship during a roll, add that relationship die to your pool twice.

# Running the Game

The first step to set up the game, is to establish where the game takes place, and what tone the game will have.

## Tone

As a group, decide what sort of tone the game should take. Reference or roll on the table below to help establish the tone.

D4 | Tone
:-: | :-:
1 | Comedic, ala What We Do in the Shadows or It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
2 | Over the Top Drama such as a reality show or Soap Opera
3 | Dark and Gritty Drama like something you'd find on HBO
4 | Dramedy, something that's not afraid to make you laugh and give you big feelings

## The Setting

Decide what sort of environment the game is set in. You can roll or choose from the table below, or simply use it as inspiration.

D6 | Setting
:-: | :-:
1 | Tropical
2 | Forest
3 | Mountainous
4 | Swamp
5 | Desert
6 | Plains

Decide what sort of settlement your story takes place in or near

D6 | Settlement
:-: | :-:
1 | A small rural village
2 | A sprawling metropolis
3 | A bustling trade port
4 | A popular tourist town
5 | An isolated bastion
6 | A sparsely populated rural area

Go around the table, and have every player (including yourself) suggest an important location

## The Situation

The second step is to create a situation, and the people involved in it

### What new thing is causing a disruption?

D6 | Disruption
:-: | :-:
1 | A hot new being of the veil
2 | A hot new mortal has moved in
3 | Someone is searching for beings of the veil
4 | Construction is set to start near supernatural land
5 | Something new is calling on the power of the veil
6 | A being of the veil is doing something that might get them exposed

### Create some NPCs

Roll on the table below to Create 3-5 NPCs

NPCs come in two forms
- **Dolls** These are important NPCs that come with their own relationships and stress tracks. Create 2 or more Dolls.
- **Extras** These are simple NPCs that are essentially part of the environment that can talk. Extras do not have Stats and are instead represented by a single die and possibly an Aspect or two. Create 4 or more Extras.

D8 | Type | Style |Adjective | Person
:-: | :-: | :-:
1 | Tall | Butch | Ambitious | Witch
2 | Short | Femme | Nervous | Mothperson
3 | Athletic | Cottagecore |Curious | Fae
4 | Thicc | Futch | Territorial | Vampire
5 | Muscular | Punk | Sleepy | Ghost
6 | Thin | Nerdy | Greedy | Human
7 | Mom-bod | Professional | Loyal | Bigfoot
8 | Fat | Outdoorsy | Vengeful | Alien

### Assign Dice

Give Each Doll a D10 Stat, two D6 stats, and one D4 stat, a D8 Aspect, a D6 Aspect, and a D6 Negative Aspect.

Extras are by default a D8 with one die that describes them, and possibly a D6 Aspect or two.

Give each Doll a d8 important relationship with another character. 1 or 2 d6 mildly important relationships. All unlisted relationships are a d4. Extras do not have relationships. At this point, have the Bottoms set their relationships with the Dolls and each other.

## Top Principles

You are playing the world. Make the world feel dramatic, but logically consistent. Think of Dolls as the supporting cast of a dramatic TV show or Movie, and the Extras as extras with only a handful of spoken lines. The narrative is incredibly player driven and can change, so occasionally an Extra can become a Doll, especially if a Bottom spends Drive to create a relationship with them. The narrative does not need to be told in a linear fashion, so feel free to do flashback scenes or run two different scenes in parallel when the opportunity arises.

## Set the Scene

Ask the players where they are at and how they are responding to the disruption. Start the first scene with whoever got into a new relationship most recently and the Bottoms and NPCs that would be in that location as well. Frame each scene by describing the environment, who is there, and start directly in the action by having some of the characters already in conflict with one another.

## Call for rolls

When a character is trying to influence another character, or whenever a character is trying to overcome an obstacle with risks involved, a roll is called. The character initiating this action creates their dice pool first. For Bottoms, the dice is made up of the stat that best matches their approach, and any relevant assets and aspects. For the Top, the dice pool is made up of dice that represent the difficulty of the action, or from traits of the NPC. In addition to this, each party gets the appropriate stress die from their opposition, and can give their opponent 1 Drive to use a negative aspect. The highest die in each pool is compared.
The chatacter or obstacle with the highest die result gets what they want with the initiator winning ties.
The lowest die in each pool is also compared to determine if there is a bonus effect or an extra cost.

## Stress

Dolls have stress tracks just like Bottoms, and can become Overwhelmed. However, Obstacles and Extras that take more than one action to overcome or manipulate have a singular progress track that counts up just as a stress track would. The progress track starts at a d4 and a success steps up the die size by one. A Resounding Success steps up the progress by 2. The complexity of the task determines how far the progress track needs to go before completion, a short task needs to reach a d8, a medium length task needs to reach a d10 or d12, and a long task needs to be raised above a d12. If two characters are trying to affect an Obstacle or Extra in different ways, they each get a progress track and race to their goal.

## Drive

The Top can spend Drive in all of the same ways that Bottoms can, with the exception of creation relationships with Extras. However, the Top gains drive in a different way. The Top starts with 1 drive for each Bottom, and gain Drive only when it is spent by Bottoms. For each Roll where a Bottom spends Drive, the Top will gain 1 Drive after the roll is resolved. When a Bottom spends 5 Drive to re-evaluate a relationship, the top gains 1 Drive. The Top can also spend 1 Drive to create a new Extra or Obstacle not previously established in the scene.
