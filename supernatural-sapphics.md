# Supernatural Sapphics

Supernatural Sapphics is a role playing game for 2 or more players, one player taking the role of the Top, who runs the game, and the rest of the players take the role of Bottoms, which are characters in the game. This Distortion Dice game is about the messy queer relationships between beings of the veil (vampires, fae, ghosts, cryptids, etc) and the humans fascinated by them. This is not a game about working together to overcome a common goal, the characters in Supernatural Sapphics can be toxic, selfish, or simply naive and will end up hurting each other. Player vs Player conflict is not only expected, it is ecouraged. While this game does use terms like sapphic, woman, and lesbian, you are not required to play a lesbian, and all types of identities are welcome. However, it is fundamentally a game about disaster queers and their relationships, so if your desire is to play a cishet character, you should take time to examine why that is, and if that character would fit into the stories this game is meant to tell.

You start with one relationship at d10, one at d8, two at d4 and the rest at d6


## Rolls

In order to affect the other characters around you, or when there's a risk involved for any action, you make a roll. Rolls in Supernatural Sapphics are made by building a dice pool, rolling against another dice pool, and comparing the highest and lowest die. Results are determined by who is the initiator, as well as what the highest and lowest die in each pool was.

You start by picking the stat that best matches your approach to the action you are attempting. You may also add in the relevant aspects and relationships that would help you, if rolling against another player you also get the relevant stress die for their approach. Whoever is opposing you gets the stress die that matches your approach, in addition to the dice for their own approach and any relevant aspects or relationships.

For the initiator, the Highest die determines if the result is extremely positive (beating the opposition by 5+), positive (beating or tying the opposition), or negative (beaten by the opposition).

The lowest die determines if there is a bonus effect (beating the opposition) or an extra cost (tie or being beaten by the opposition).

On a positive or extremely positive result, the initiator narrates the outcome. On a negative result, the opposition narrates. The initiator gets to decide what small bonus effect there is, and the opposition would decide the extra cost, which can be a narrative only consequence or stress.

## Drive

Drive is gained when you suffer negative consequences, either through a negative result or a mixed result. You can spend one drive to step up a die in your pool to the next die size. You can also spend one to invoke a negative aspect in a roll against another character. You can spend 5 to reevaluate a relationship, which allows you to change how you view that person. If you do this during a roll, use that relationship die twice. Re-evaluating a relationship fully clears one stress track.

## Reducing Stress

Reducing Stress can be done in three ways. The first is taking a moment to rest and process your emotions. This reduces a single stress track by 1 step.

The second is through connection. Talking to a friend or allowing someone to help you reduces your stress. The person helping will roll against the stress track they are trying to reduce. On an extremely positive result it is reduced by 3, on a positive result it is reduced by 2, and a negative result still reduces your stress by 1. The bonus effect is reducing a stress track of their own by 1, and an extra cost is raising their stress track by 1. This means that a negative result with an extra cost raises their stress by 2. As usual, the die being rolled by the person helping should be the one that best fits their approach to the problem. Helping someone else recover from stress always grants 1 inspiration, regardless of any stress received.

The second is through reevaluating a relationship. If you spend 5 drive to re-evaulate a relationship, you fully clear a stress track.
