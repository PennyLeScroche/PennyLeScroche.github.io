Fatigue can be lowered by 1 by stopping to rest once per day. Resting for the night can lower fatigue anywhere from 0-2 depending on how well you sleep.
Thirst can be lowered by 1 by stopping to drink once per day if you have a source of water
Hunger can be lowered by 1 by snacking on something once per day.

Stopping to make a meal can lower thirst, hunger, and fatigue and can be done up to 3 times per day if you have the resources. There is a roll to prepare the meal from the ingredients you have that will determine the quality of the meal at the end and the amount that your character enjoys it. Both of these affect the amount that you can heal from your meal.

Fear is only lowered through someone comforting you or by removing the source of the fear.
