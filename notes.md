### Harm

Harm can only be reduced through a specific action, or through rest. A short rest is a few minutes and can reduce a harm track by one. A long rest is a full night and can reduce each harm track by one. You can take an action appropriate for each harm track to try and reduce it, but failure means increasing it.

If Harm is raised above a d12, that character is incapacitated and takes on or raises a negative aspect. An incapacitated character is retired if they are not removed from that situation. An incapacitated character cannot act on their own. If a negative aspect would be raised above a d12 that character is automatically retired and cannot be saved.

### Tension Die

this is an optional die that represents the constant tension and risk involved in an investigation. There are two version of the Tension Die, a rising Tension Die, and a Static Tension Die. The static Tension Die is constant and represents the constant supernatural threat of an investigation. Like all other dice, it can be anywhere from a d4 to a d12. Unlike other dice, it cannot be stepped down.

The rising Tension die starts at a d4 or d6 and represents a potentially growing threat. As the players investigate, background forces are also going to work towards their goals, and when those goals are achieved, the tension die grows. If those goals are thwarted, the tension die shrinks. If it raises above a d12, the ultimate goal of the antagonists is reached, the players, and possible the entire world, lose. If it's lowered below a d4, the antagonists are defeated, and their threat is gone.
