**Aspects**

Your Role (navigator, hunter, Researcher, protector, scout, etc)
Your goal (your reason for exploring, what you're looking for)
Your background (where are you from, and what did you do before becoming an explorer)

Negative aspects are trauma. you start with 2. these can only be reduced during advancement.

for most checks you rotate through fatigue, thirst, and hunger. For some specific challenges you can take fear and injury.

Fatigue can be lowered by 1 by stopping to rest once per day. Resting for the night can lower fatigue anywhere from 0-2 depending on how well you sleep.
Thirst can be lowered by 1 by stopping to drink once per day if you have a source of water
Hunger can be lowered by 1 by snacking on something once per day.

Stopping to make a meal can lower thirst, hunger, and fatigue and can be done up to 3 times per day if you have the resources. There is a roll to prepare the meal from the ingredients you have that will determine the quality of the meal at the end and the amount that your character enjoys it. Both of these affect the amount that you can heal from your meal.

Fear is only lowered through someone comforting you or by removing the source of the fear.

Injury can be lowered through a good nights rest or through treatment.

Other conditions such as curses, poisons, etc can be incurred which will require specific actions

Advance only between adventures, or if you can rest for several days in a safe place.

Time is your metacurrency, spend it to improve your odds. You start each day with a certain amount of time points, and spend them to show that youre spending extra time on a task, or to show that you dif something to prepare for it earlier. 

excess time can be spent during rest for extra recovery. 

Recovering from stress gives experience, 1xp per die level recovered.

**Assets**

assets come in two forms, degradable and consumable.
Degradable assets are most assets, they degrade over time, represented by their die lowering on a failure. These can be repaired by an appropriate craftsman, or through a roll if you have the appropriate materials.

consumable assets are usable only once. these are things like potions

ammuniton for a ranged weapon or torches could be a degradable asset where the die size represents the quantity left.

Asset management will be needed 

There will be roll tables for what resources can be found based on biome. Fewer natural resources in deserts and in dungeons for example.
