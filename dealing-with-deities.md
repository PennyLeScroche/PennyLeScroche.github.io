# Dealing with Deities

a GMless card based game about Dysfunctional Demigods.

In this game, the gods are dead, and their children feel they don't get the respect they deserve. Despite their infinite lives, demigods tend to be self-absorbed, petty, dramatic, and impulsive. This is ultimately a game about dramatic and selfish people who happen to have powers. These people both love and hate each other, and generally live to manipulate one another and the mortals they run into.

### How to Play

When you want to do something with uncertainty, or when you want to use your powers draw cards. You draw two by default and can expend your power tokens to draw more. Compare the highest and lowest card you draw against two (or more) cards drawn in opposition, creating a yes/and, no/but system. If cards are the same face, they are ordered by suit. Hearts are the lowest, followed by diamonds, clubs, and spades being the highest.

If your highest card is higher than the oppositions you get what you want, if it's lower you do not. If your lowest card is higher than the oppositions you get something good that wasn't what you wanted. If your lowest card is lower something goes wrong.

Expend your power to increase the number of cards drawn. When going against an NPC or other minor obstacles, only draw two cards. When opposing another demigod, you can both expend power to draw more cards.

### Creating the situation and scenes

After characters are created, answer the situation questions as a group to create a situation. You may wish to employ a white board, large piece of paper, or digital flowchart to track what is happening and how everyone feels about it. Not all of the situation prompt questions need to be used. If a question feels like it is throwing off what is already established, or if the group decides that they simply don't think it sounds fun, feel free to throw that prompt out.

Once a situation has been established, play takes place in the form of a number of scenes. The number of scenes will be the number of players plus one. Each player will get to establish their own scene within the situation that centers their character. At the end, there will also be a scene with all of the characters together. This can be an epilogue scene or a climactic scene depening on how the previous scenes played out. Any number of demigods can be in any scene so long as it makes sense with what has happened in previous scenes. Scenes do not need to happen chronologically, some scenes can be flashbacks or occur simultaneously with other scenes. If a demigod is not in a scene, the player of that demigod plays the mortals in the scene. Mortals always draw two cards when initiating or reacting to an action.
