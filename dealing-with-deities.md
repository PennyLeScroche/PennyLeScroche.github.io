# Dealing with Deities

a GMless card based game about Dysfunctional Demigods.

In this game, the gods are dead, and their children feel they don't get the respect they deserve. Despite their infinite lives, demigods tend to be self-absorbed, petty, dramatic, and impulsive. This is ultimately a game about dramatic and selfish people who happen to have powers.

compare the highest and lowest card you draw against two (or more) cards drawn in opposition, creating a yes/and, no/but system. If cards are the same face, they are ordered by suit. Hearts are the lowest, followed by diamonds, clubs, and spades being the highest.

Expend your power to increase the number of cards drawn. When going against an NPC or other minor obstacles, only draw two cards. When opposing another demigod, you can both expend power to draw more cards.

Scenes are created one at a time. One per player + 1 at the end with everyone. If a player is not in the scene, they play the mortals in the scene.

To create characters, deal out 5 cards to each player, and assign them to the different character aspects. You should have one card leftover.
