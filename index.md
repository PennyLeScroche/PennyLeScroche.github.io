# Hi, I'm Khampheng,
but you can call me Penny. I'm a very queer asian american nerd. I mostly talk about TTRPG stuff, but occasionally delve into my other nerdy interests such as privacy, open source software, indie videogames, and fighting games.

There's a good chance you're here for the [Titterpig Academy Discord](https://bit.ly/titterpig). So go ahead and click that link. If that's not why you're here, maybe consider joining anyway. We're a bunch of cool people who are passionate about ttrpgs and want to help people learn them.

I've got a [pronouns.page](en.pronouns.page/pennylescroche) if you want to know all my pronouns and what terms I'm comfortable with.

I've also got an [itch](pennylescroche.itch.io) page where I put my games
