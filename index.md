There's a good chance you're here for the [Titterpig Academy Discord](https://bit.ly/titterpig). So go ahead and click that link. If that's not why you're here, maybe consider joining anyway. We're a bunch of cool people who are passionate about ttrpgs and want to help people learn them.

My games will now be published under the name Transcendent Tapir, which is the name of the game development cooperative I'm starting. Website coming soon, join the [discord](https://tinyurl/transtapir) to follow along, discuss our games, and we are also open to accepting contributors in the form of contractors or owners.
