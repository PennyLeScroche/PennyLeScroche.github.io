# Trials of the Chosen one
### Will you embrace your destiny, or create your own?

This is a semi adversarial imposition dice game for two players. One player plays the Hero, the other plays the Immortal. This game is played out as a number of trials that take place at various points in the Hero's life. Each time, the Immortal will thrust a challenge upon the Hero to help them grow and ensure that they are worthy. Each trial can be as many sessions as you would like, but 1-3 is recommended. Each trial allows the hero to change and grow, and as such, there will be downtime mechanics that allow the Hero to upgrade their paths and aspects.
On the last trial, the Hero can then choose to defy destiny and instead attack the Immortal for everything that they've put the Hero through.

The Hero's paths are:

- Courage
- Selflessness
- Perservearance

Additionally, the Hero has a Hero die, which starts as a d4 when they are young, and is raised after every trial

Aspects are not tied to a specific path for the Hero. Each aptitude has a maximum value of 2, but multiple aptitudes can be applied to each roll.

to do:
- Aptitude List
- Card based Trials generator
  - Face value determines trial
  - Suit determines twist/theme
  - Trial will test a path and that path will automatically grow between trials
