### How to Play

Create your creature, and choose 3 of the selected story seeds. If you are playing with only 2 players, draw an additional story seed.

Based on the story seeds, create a starting situation. For example, if your story seeds were "I don't feel so good", "need snacks", and "what's that smell" You might come up with a situation where the players feel incredibly hungry and there is a neighbor cooking something. A combination of "My thing is missing", "that's not supposed to be there", and "a gift for the witch" could be turned into a situation where one companion had a gift they wanted to give to the witch, but it has gone missing, and things in the house have moved, so the players believe someone broke in or the house is haunted.

The player that has most recently pet an animal leads the first scene as the spotlight player. Each player will get a scene to lead, players whose characters are not in the scene should play any available NPCs or give input when it is needed. When a scene ends, the spotlight player selects the next player to lead a scene. When every player has lead a scene, there will be a final scene with all of the players. 

When you want to do something risky, or channel your magic, you draw cards. If you are drawing against another player, you draw cards and compare against them, if you are drawing against an NPC, environmental obstacle, or any other challenge, a player not in the scene should draw. 

Once cards are drawn, compare the highest and lowest cards on each side. The side with the highest high card gets what they want. The side with the highest low card gets to create a small bonus or complication.

By default, you draw 2 cards. You can draw additional cards for each tag that would help you in your task. If you are using your magic, spend tokens to draw additional cards. 

If you wish to help someone with a challenge, use your tags or spend a token to add additional cards to their draw.
