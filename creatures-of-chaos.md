How to Play

Create your creature, and choose 3 story seeds. 

Based on the story seeds, create a starting situation. The player that has most recently pet an animal leads the first scene as the spotlight player. Each player will get a scene to lead, players whose characters are not in the scene should play any available NPCs or give input when it is needed. When a scene ends, the spotlight player selects the next player to lead a scene. When every player has lead a scene, there will be a final scene with all of the players. 

When you want to do something risky, or channel your magic, you draw cards. If you are drawing against another player, you draw cards and compare against them, if you are drawing against an NPC, environmental obstacle, or any other challenge, a player not in the scene should draw. 

By default, you draw 2 cards. You can draw additional cards for each tag that would help you in your task. If you are using your magic, spend tokens to draw additional cards. 

If you wish to help someone with a challenge, use your tags or spend a token to add additional cards to their draw.
